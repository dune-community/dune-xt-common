dune-xt-common is an eXTensions module for DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org),
which is often used together with [dune-xt-grid](https://github.com/dune-community/dune-xt-grid),
[dune-xt-functions](https://github.com/dune-community/dune-xt-functions) and
[dune-xt-la](https://github.com/dune-community/dune-xt-la) in the context of
the discretization module [dune-gdt](https://github.com/dune-community/dune-gdt).

There is a paper describing some of the concepts behind these extensions. While
already dated, most ideas still apply:

```

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
